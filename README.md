# Spam-Detection-Text-Classifier

classify spam versus non spam SMS

# Method- Text Classifier

Text classification is the process of assigning tags or categories to text according to its content. Itâ€™s one of the fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with broad applications such as sentiment analysis, topic labeling, spam detection, and intent detection(fraud, hate speech, trolling etc).

# Dataset
Data source :https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00228/ 

The files contain one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: one with label (ham or spam) and other with the raw text.

# Content
 
This is an end to end project that will keep NLP pipeline for text data in focus. So, it consists of following Jupyter Notebooks;

- 1.Introduction to dataset : Loading data, Data exploration, visualization and checking most frequent words' cloud
- 2.Cleaning Data: Using text preprocessing techniques (Lower casing, Punctuation removal,Stopwords removal,Frequent words removal,Rare words removal,Spelling correction,Tokenization,Stemming,Lemmatization)
- 3.Basic Model: Applying Logistic classification model plus model evaluation
- 4.Vectorize+Model:Performing different types of vectorization to check which one performs better four techniques for vectorization(Bag of words,TF-IDF,Word2Vec Embedding,Doc2Vec Embedding)
- 5.Applying all four vectorize techniques with multiple machine learning algorithms to choose best tested model
- 6.Applying recurrent neural network for text classification by using keras and tensorflow
